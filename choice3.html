			<h2>You feel great. You start telling your boss all your "genius" ideas for re-organizing the entire store, right in the middle of the rush. When they ask you to wait, you get furious, yell at them for "not seeing the vision," and walk out.</h2>
			<!-- Depressive -->
			<h2>Every order feels impossible. You spill a drink and feel a crushing wave of guilt, convinced you're worthless and are going to be fired. You ask to go home sick.</h2>
