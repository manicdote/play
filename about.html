			<!--Mania-->
			<div>
				<h2 class="subtitle-2">Mania</h2>
				<p>A state of intense elevated mood, irritability, and energy. It's an extreme state that is a clear and significant departure from a person's normal self.</p>
				<div>
					<p>Common symptoms include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g., "I'm a genius,")</li>
						<li>Drastically decreased need for sleep (e.g., feeling totally rested after 1-2 hours)</li>
						<li>Pressured speech (talking so fast it's hard to interrupt)</li>
						<li>Flight of ideas (thoughts are racing and jumping between topics)</li>
						<li>Extreme distractibility</li>
						<li>High-risk, impulsive behavior (e.g., massive spending sprees, reckless decisions)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Key Distinguishing Features:</p>
